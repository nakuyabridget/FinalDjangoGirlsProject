<h2>Pair programming</h2>
<p>When this journey of django girls began,<br>we were grouped into pairs of two and me and my pairement were lucky to
    get eachother<br>
    as a team.This process of grouping us into two has helped us to work in a team, to synergise,and to become better
    people while working together.</p>
